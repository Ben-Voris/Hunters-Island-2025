## 2025-08-03 Boise to Eau Claire

Royce fetches me and my luggage from MSP to Dunbar's Canoe Outfitting in Eau
Claire. We have a nightcap, look at pictures, and chat.

## 2025-08-04 Preparations in Eau Claire

*Mighty were their preparations.*

Royce has things well organized&mdash;food, drink, and fuel bought, and shared
gear found, tested, and organized. But we still manage to run hither and
thither. We put things into things and then those things into other things and
those things into his truck. We even pack our passports so that they'll be easy
to access.

## 2025-08-05 Eau Claire to Zups

 We set an alarm for 0-dark-thirty. Brenda takes what she calls &ldquo;the final
picture.&rdquo;

![Ben and Royce, ready to roll](./attachments/202508050826-000.jpeg "Ben and Royce, ready to roll 2025-08-05")

The drive to Crane Lake was easy, except for some construction around Duluth. At
the marina, we unloaded our gear and canoe into Zups' boat, arranged parking,
and headed off.

![Royce in Zups boat on the way to Canadian customs](./attachments/202508051556-000.jpeg "Royce in Zups boat on the way to Canadian customs")

Clearing customs on Sandpoint Lake was painless. We were met by two agents and
briefly chatted with one. The fact that we were slightly over our duty-free
liquor allotment was waved off, and we were on our way, including two rail
portages.

![Beatty rail Portage around Loon Falls](./attachments/202508051638-001.jpeg "Beatty rail Portage around Loon Falls")

Cold beer. Dinner is minestrone soup, pasta salad, good prime rib, baked
potato, and asparagus. Carrot cake for dessert. Our server was a young woman
from New Zealand who works at a similar operation in New Zealand during
their summer.

After dinner, we were shuttled to rooms on another island. The room was
acceptably shabby, but we were surprised at the lack of potable water.
Fortunately, I'd filled our bottles at the dining hall.

A small group was cleaning fish on the dock.

![Royce in room at Zups 2025-08-05 19:53:34](./attachments/202508051953-000.jpeg "Royce in room at Zups 2025-08-05 19:53:34")

Threatening rain.

## 2025-08-06 Day 1: Lac la Croix to Crooked Lake, north of Saturday Bay

We've been in camp for an hour or so. I used the inReach to let the home front
know that we are here and that we are safe.

Zups picked us up promptly at 6:30. After breakfast, at around 9:00, they
dropped us off at Bottle Portage.

Before they were were dropped off at Black Robe Portage, we shared the boat with
a family that was taking their first canoe trip. Mom was *way* out of her
comfort zone but was being brave&mdash;the ride to Zups was her first time in a
boat, and she had taken her first swim lessons. Dad had been on fishing trips
before but had been one of the guys, not the guide. The daughter, who I guessed
to be about 10, was all in on whatever dad was doing. Grandma and grandpa seemed
bemused. Mom's brother seemed to think he would be lounging on a beach. Their
tent was huge and was meant for car camping&mdash;it even included a porch. It's
case had little wheels that might've been appropriate for a paved campground but
not for even the best of portages. As I understood them, their plan was to put
six people in one large canoe and to tow a solo canoe, which would hold their
gear. I wish them well.

Royce used trekking poles on the portages, which he said helped.

Saw a few groups on portages.

The paddle through Bottle Lake and Iron Lake was easy and fast.

![Royce at Crooked Lake side of Curtain Falls](./attachments/202508061209-002.jpeg "Royce at Crooked Lake side of Curtain Falls")

The Curtain Falls portage took something out of both of us. On Crooked, the wind
started to build, so I took us deep into Sunday Bay for protection from the SSW
wind. The wind kept building, but the gusts were my biggest concern. We both got
so tired we pulled up next to shore to take a break. Since we have a BWCA
permit, we decided to not fight the wind and to camp on the US side.

We leapfrogged a group of seven that were traveling in aluminum canoes.
(We later learned they are scouts.) Because of the differences between
canoes and our better technique, we moved much faster on the water than
they did. But even the woman that needed help getting her pack on moved
faster on the trail than I.

The wind made is somewhat difficult to set up the tent, but with that done, we
have &ldquo;cocktail a few minutes&rdquo;&mdash;El Jimador with lime and salt,
and snacks. We miss Jim and reminisce about our 2002 trip with him and Royce's
boys.

![Tequila on Crooked Lake 2025-08-06 17:44:35](./attachments/202508061744-000.jpeg "Tequila on Crooked Lake 2025-08-06 17:44:35")

Dinner is a bag salad and Royce's *ropa vieja* (old rope), with &ldquo;that's
not rice&rdquo; rice.

As we were pitching the tent, green beetles&mdash;the same hue as the rain
fly&mdash;were crawling on the tent. They had perfect camouflage, just in the
wrong place. We both got a kick out of that.

There are a few breaks in the clouds. It's quite still and humid and
the bugs are whining outside of tent.

## 2025-08-07 Day 2: Crooked Lake to Moose Bay of Basswood River

### 2025-08-07T18:12:17-05:00 (48.14664, -91.69657) 1254 feet: Camp in Moose Bay

We both slept hard until thunder and a short rain storm woke us. When the rain
came, we learnt that there is a trick to releasing the toggle that holds the
rain fly out of the way. One must take care to slide the toggle directly out of
the loop without any twist.

![Royce having coffee. Crooked Lake north of Saturday Bay 2025-08-07 07:51:58](./attachments/202508070751-000.jpeg "Royce having coffee. Crooked Lake north of Saturday Bay 2025-08-07 07:51:58")

On the water well after 8:00.

Sunny, calm, enervating humidity.

The scouts paddled past as we were breaking camp

When we left camp, I was so into how fast we were paddling through the light
riffles that I was't watching the map closely enough&mdash;and took us part way
into a dead-end bay. By the time I realized what I had done, we had paddled a
mile or so out of the way. I still can't paddle and navigate at the same time.

A south wind picked up. The sky went from clear to cloudy and back again a few
times.

After paddling for a few hours we slowed down, but we were still averaging
around 3 mph. When the wind shifted to our beam, we slowed more because a lot of
my effort went towards keep us on course.

***I feel like this next paragraph is on the wrong day.***
The following picture was taken Aug 7, 2025 at 12:48:39 and 't look like right.*** The fol

We decide to take a break and have a snack. Because BWCA campsites usually have
a reasonably easy out and are often open the the breeze, we headed towards the
nearest. When we got there, the terrain matched the map so exactly that I would
have been confident, even without the GPS, that we were where the site is
marked. But we saw no campsite. There was undisturbed lichen on the rocks where
the site should have been, so there has been little or no traffic there for
years. However, the nearby Quetico campsite was right where the map said it
should be *and* it had a broken BWCA fire grate. We wonder if, when the BWCA
camp was closed, some enterprising soul moved the grate across the border.

![Royce. Lunch break on Crooked Lake north of Thursday Bay](./attachments/202508071248-001.jpeg "Royce. Lunch break on Crooked Lake north of Thursday Bay")

When we entered the narrows of Crooked Lake/Basswood River, the current slowed
us to just go over 1 mph.

We decide that we're not going to do the first Basswood River portage because we
remember that the camp sites close to the portage aren't nice. Royce remembered
that we had gone into Moose Bay on one of the trips with Ian, so we turned there
and found a lovely campsite, just off the border route. We set up camp, then
Royce fished and I took a couple of short swims. &ldquo;Cocktail much less than
an hour&rdquo; with lime, salt, El Jimador, and snacks. Royce has dinner is
cooking.

Our plan was to set off early so that we can make it past the Horse Portage with
enough time to paddle far enough to reach a nice campsite on Basswood Lake.

We heard thunder in the distance several times and the skies repeatedly cycled
between overcast and clear. Now, most clouds are mares tales, so we predict good
weather well into the evening.

## 2025-08-08 Day 3: Moose Bay of Basswood River to Canadian Point on Basswood Lake

<!-- I logged this location the next morning. Coordinates and elevation got from that. The coordinates are very close to the GPS waypoint 20250808 and the elevation from map. -->
### 2025-08-08T17:59:40-05:00 (48.06107, -91.56269) 1297 feet: Camp on Canadian Point

![Royce in camp on Canadian Point of Basswood Lake](./attachments/202508081915-001.jpeg "Royce in camp on Canadian Point of Basswood Lake")

Oh God, the bugs last night. We've been lucky that they're not nearly as active
in the morning.

![Royce and canoe. Camp on Moose Bay of Basswood River](./attachments/202508080656-000.jpeg "Royce and canoe. Camp on Moose Bay of Basswood River")

We leapfrogged the group of seven. We learned that they are a scouting group
doing their Order of the Arrow trip, which I'm given to believe is a significant
milestone. Quick math told me that the sum of ages of the scouts & their guides
added up to less than the sum of our ages and that our canoe is older than any
two of them.

The Lower Basswood Falls portage was easy.

## 2025-08-09 Day 4: Basswood Lake to Carp Lake

### 2025-08-09T09:40:52-05:00 (48.06107, -91.56269) 1297 feet: Breakfast on camp on Canadian Point

THE FOLLOWING SEEMS TO BELONG TO 2025-08-08 BUT THEN WHERE IS

It's been so long since I've done this route that that I'd forgotten that there
is slightly tricky paddling where the currents of the two falls collide on the
downstream end of the Wheelbarrow Falls Portage.

In spots, the river had flooded the portage, but the trail bed was good and so
we just sloshed through the water.

I'd entirely forgotten about the short portage before the Horse Portage. The
current was such that we couldn't land where I wanted to, which turned out to be
a good thing because we ended up at an easier landing. On this portage, we met a
young couple that were heading to Crooked. They were carrying only two small
packs in addition their canoe and two paddles (no spare). We greatly admire
their gear discipline.

We caught up with the scouts again on the Horse Portage. They plan to do it
halfway and then camp for the night. We slog through. It's long, hot,
muggy, and hard, but not as hard as I'd feared.

At the Basswood Lake end, the wind was blowing directly into the portage
landing. The trees were swaying, waves were breaking off shore and, as far as we
could see, there were white horses.

We had a brief discussion of how we might get through the surf but quickly gave
that up as silly. So, since the wind was making it quite pleasant on shore and
there was no traffic (no sensible person would have chosen to be on Basswood in
this wind), we did the sensible thing and took a nap. We puttered around for a
bit, hanging our sweaty clothes to dry, etc., before we unrolled our RidgeRests
and got serious. An hour or so later, we were awoken by the wind dropping. Royce
has the brilliant idea of having coffee, so we do that load the boat. By the
time we were off, we were paddling through rollers but no chop, which made for
easy and fast paddling. With the coffee on board, we paddled at morning pace for
more than an hour.

![Royce with canoe at Basswood Lake end of Horse Portage](./attachments/202508081609-000.jpeg "Royce with canoe at Basswood Lake end of Horse Portage")

The overcast so thick that I wondered how late it was (it was only 19:00). As
usual distances and sizes are not intuitive to us, so we spent time double
checking the map and GPS. Mildly annoying, but we never went astray.

Got into camp, set up the tent, and have tequila and limes. This is a
pleasant campsite although footing is bad&mdash;rocks and sticks everywhere.

We are tired. Royce made a quick meal of dried chicken, dried vegetables, and
ramen. It was better than the backpacker meals and only a little messier (one
pot, two spoons, and two cups to wash). We slurped it down, had a little more
tequila, and started putting camp to bed.

Then the bugs came. Double-plus ungood. So bad I put on my bug net and didn't
brush my teeth. The net helped a lot under the bill of my cap but not so much
around the ears.

We didn't properly close one of the tent doors fast enough, and so we spent
several minutes killing mosquitoes by the light of our headlamps. (Each tent
door has two zippers that must be brought together carefully so that a little
flap covers the hole where the zippers don't quite touch).

In the tent, it was so hot that I couldn't sleep. We listened to an audio book
version of *Footfall* while I mopped sweat off my face.

At some point in the night, thunder woke us. When the rain started, I had to get
out of the tent to untangle the toggle that holds the rain fly aside, much as
Royce did two nights before.

As the rain petered out, I drifted off. Then the big storm rolled in.
It rained hard for a while&mdash;no idea how long. The tent was lit by
lightning several times and there was loud thunder.

This morning, some noise woke Royce and we slowly crawled out of the tent.
Yesterday was a big day for us and we're not spritely. So, we enjoy our coffee,
chat, and amble around camp, stopping to stare at things and to shake water off
the tent and our packs. (Everything important was in a pack and was dry. So far,
our camp discipline is good.)

There is still a slight breeze from the south, so the thunderstorm brought no
major weather change. The overcast is moderately thick, but not as thick as
yesterday evening. A few bugs are around but not too many.

## 2025-08-10  Day 5: Canadian Point on Basswood Lake to Carp Lake

### 2025-08-10T08:36:25-05:00 (48.09174, -91.31100) 1370 feet: Camp on Carp Lake

The landing for this camp is through brush and there is no place to sit
out or swim, but it's the best of a bad lot.

This site, and the three others in Quetico that are nearby, are little
used. All but this one have trees down making it not at all obvious that
there ever was a place to camp. If we had not looked carefully, we would
not have seen the tumbled down fire rings. Here, the fire rings has a
green sprout growing in it.

![Fire ring on Carp Lake 2025-08-10 08:43:39](./attachments/202508100843-000.jpeg "Fire ring on Carp Lake 2025-08-10 08:43:39")

All the campsites on the US side were occupied.

I would've liked to have made it to Robinson Island but we were both
too tired.

While breakfasting and packing, we've been discussing a possible
alternate route: just north of us, there is a 280 feet/17 rod portage to
Crawford Lake. After a short paddle, there is a 0.4 miles/135 rod
portage to Back Bay of Knife Lake, which comes out north of Robbins
Island. It looks interesting.

A middle-aged couple paddles past, heading south (so they would have
passed the portage to Crawford) but we don't think to ask them where
they came in. We decide to not risk portages we know nothing about and
to continue on our planned route. I.e., paddle back to the portage to
Seed Lake.

The paddle across Basswood was as easy as I've ever had and we made
very good time to Prairie (we arrived there at 14:53).

(Packing note: yesterday, we had moved both pairs of our Chaco &ldquo;magic
sandals&rdquo; from the personal pack to the gear pack and were surprised how
notable the extra weight was. Today, to balance the load, we moved one
pair to the food pack.)

Yesterday, the weather was calm until evening, with clouds rolling in
and out. When we made camp, the wind was notable. When we went to the
tent, the wind had almost died but not quite entirely. It is now low,
with occasional gusts. No clouds excepting a few mares tales.

Hash browns with hamburger and gravy for dinner last night. Leftovers
and oatmeal this morning. Brown gravy residue does't go as well with
coffee as does oatmeal. The food barrels are notably lighter and we're
already moving gear into them.

Saw an Osprey nest on Basswood. On Carp, our presence offended a beaver.

I choose to paddle along the north shore of Birch Lake. I'd forgotten
how many down trees there in the water. A few trees are standing well
out in the lake. The first dam at Prairie Portage was built around 1900.
Could these standing dead trees be from before that?

## 2025-08-10 Day 5: Carp Lake to Ottertrack Lake

![Royce on Big Knife Portage](./attachments/202508101133-000.jpeg "Royce on Big Knife Portage")

### 2025-08-10T20:28:15-05:00 (48.15676, -91.12724) 1409 feet: Camp on Ottertrack Lake

We made camp on the US side of Ottertrack, shortly after the portage from Knife
Lake.

We paddled into a headwind when we left camp on Carp, but then most of
the day we were paddling in ideal conditions. The last couple of hours
on Knife were challenging with quartering winds on the stern. Even so,
we made great time, topping out at 5 mph for short stretches.

The portage from Carp to Melon, our first, was packed. There were at
least three parties: one couple and two groups of guys. The guys were
carrying a menagerie of gear: packs, duffels, boxes, and hand-junk.
Though I sometimes I feel we need to improve how we portage, when I see
something like them, I don't feel quite so bad.

Saw many loons. One pair of let us paddle within 6 feet.

On one of the portages, we met a couple and their seven-year-old and
five-year-old girls. Mom made it known that both daughters were experienced
voyageurs and &ldquo;portage queens&rdquo;. The older had made her first canoe
trip at age 3 on Seagull Lake and said that she remembered how fun it was to
portage to Alpine for a picnic. The younger raised her arms and yelled
&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; whenever mom or dad said &ldquo;portage queens&rdquo;.

Had lunch on the west campsite on Robbins Island and took a 15 or 20
minute rest. It is a lovely site.

I had trouble finding the Knife Lake narrows. That is, I went directly to the
right place but couldn't believe that what I was looking at was &ldquo;the
narrows&rdquo; because it is really, really narrow&mdash;so small and rocky that
we could barely float through it. We stopped, looked at maps, and cursed
for several minutes before realizing what I had seen had to be the
narrows.

The Little Knife Portage (Knife to Ottertrack) was hidden by brush and was hard
to find. It had the steepest climb&mdash;a real up-and-down.

BWCA portages tend to be easy to find, well-traveled, and well
maintained. The portages today were no exception.

We finished the last of the tequila and switched to bourbon and had our
first backpacker meal. As before, it is food. They have reduced the
sodium but have not improved the taste. Royce had a particularly
reprehensible take on Spanish Rice called *Italian Style Pepper Steak*.
I found it boring but edible.

Good day and good weather. Paddling was challenging enough to keep me
focused. The wind forced me to paddle on one side for long stretches
which was awfully tiring, but needs must.

Campsite is on the US side. They are notably more heavily used and have
obnoxious/aggressive chipmunks.

Tomorrow, we turn north into a bay of Ottertrack that I've never seen.
THen we head into Jasper and further north into Quetico.

## 2025-08-11 Day 6: Ottertrack Lake to Saganons Lake

### 2025-08-11T19:04:01-05:00 (48.26726, -91.04823) 1411 feet: Camp on Saganons Lake

Ottertrack Lake was as pretty as I remember. I snapped a few pictures
that I'm sure do not do justice.

Today, the portages were hard to find and and had difficult landings.

The portage from Ottertrack to Jasper stopped at a pond (48.20708, -91.07873 to
48.20694, -91.07861) where we had to paddle a few hundred feet to get to the
next part of the portage.

![Royce on portage after mid trail pond on Ottertrack to Jasper](./attachments/202508111219-000.jpeg "Royce on portage after mid trail pond on Ottertrack to Jasper")

The landings for the portage between Jasper Lake and Lillypad Lake was
difficult on both sides, but the trail was fairly easy and showed recent
maintenance.

We had lunch on Jasper at quite a nice site. But we have miles to go.

The last portage, from Lillypad to Saganons was, by far, the worst of the day.
The start was so steep that when I tipped the bow far enough up, I had to fight
to keep the boat from sliding off backwards. Before each step, I had to
carefully pick where to put my feet and to gather my strength&mdash;nothing like
the quick &ldquo;giant step, quick step, step, step, giant step&rdquo; of years
past. On the descent, the canoe repeatedly slid forward, off my shoulders, until
it rested on my neck. The finish was a muddy stream that was &ldquo;too thin to
portage and too thick to paddle.&rdquo; which gradually opened to Saganons. It
required much shenanigans to get our gear, and then ourselves away from shore
and into the canoe. Taking a page from Peter delValle, we loaded the canoe and
then pushed it while sinking past our knees in the muck and floating grass,
until eventually the water was deep enough to float the canoe while we
oh-so-gracefully embarked.

![Royce on Saganons end of portage from Lillypad](./attachments/202508111537-000.jpeg "Royce on Saganons end of portage from Lillypad")

We saw toad on the portage and a leopard frog at the lake. That portage
left us both so tired enough we stopped early. We got the tent up and
took a quick swim to rinse off some of the loon poop.

Sometime after lunch, the smoke started to blow in. Red sky now even
though the sun is a couple hand widths above the horizon.

In tent at 2020. When the wind started to die down, the mosquitoes
started to buzz. But by then we had camp set for the night, our teeth
brushed, etc., and so were ready to pop into the tent.

## 2025-08-12 Day 7: Saganons Lake to Koko Falls

### 2025-08-12T18:35:35-05:00 (48.31220, -91.11031) 1346 feet

We make dinner at the end of Little Falls portage since we figure that
if we wait to make dinner until we're in camp, it'll be dark and we'd
be swarmed by mosquitoes.

We paddled around the big peninsula on Saganons because the portage was
not where the *Fisher* and *NatGeo* maps show it. (One thing about the
GPS&mdash;we know for sure where we are.) The *BRMB Paddling Trails* map
shows the portage to the east, around a small peninsula, but we decided
not to take the time to look there. We made good time heading east and
reasonably good time heading west. I don't know how much time or if we
lost time paddling an extra seven miles vs. an unknown portage.

![Royce. Lunch break on Saganons Lake](./attachments/202508121303-000.jpeg "Royce. Lunch break on Saganons Lake")

Thunderstorm blew through while we were portaging. Hazy overcast now.

![View downstream of Little Falls 2025-08-12 18:37:35](./attachments/202508121837-000.jpeg "View downstream of Little Falls 2025-08-12 18:37:35")

### 2025-08-12T21:14:03-05:00 (48.31543, -91.11356) 1365 feet

It was getting dark, so we made camp on a marginal site near Koko Falls, just
off the portage.

We've been the tent for a few minutes. If only we've been here a few tens of
minutes earlier so we could've done things like our brush teeth.

Another party was camped across the river from the start of the portage.

We saw two groups of three canoes each. One on Saganons and the other
leaving the river.

It was a longer day than we expected. We do a poor job of estimating
travel time from the map. And of course, we did not expect up to paddle
around the peninsula. And, something has happened in the last 23 years
to make the portages harder.

## 2025-08-13 Day 8: Koko Falls to west of Rose Island on Kawnipi Lake

### 2025-08-13T20:25:34-05:00 (48.38173, -91.30458) 1325 feet

We were out of camp by 9:15 and on the water by 10:00.

We meet Bob and Janice, formally of Calgary. They were camped before the
portage. She told us that, when they saw us paddle to the portage in half-light,
they thought we were a couple of hard-core guys who trying to race through the
Hunters Island loop. We explained that we were only racing against the light
because we had screwed up.

We chat for a bit. Bob had an ankle replacement within the year and said that
he is happy with the results. Janet said she was 76 and that her husband
was &ldquo;much older&rdquo;. They were carrying less than us: two smaller rubber
packs with hip belts, a single food barrel of about the size of one of
the two we carry (i.e., smaller than the usual), and a Souris River 17
canoe. They are shopping for a lighter canoe so that they can continue
doing these trips. To give him a break, I carried Bob's personal pack
on top of our food pack. (Maybe someone will do that for me in a decade
or sooner.) When we left them, they were looking at the rapids after the
falls. They had decided to run them them without gear in their canoe and
were discussing details. I gather they did not think the rapids would be
particularly challenging. They were a pleasure to chat with and gave us
both hope that we might be on a trail like this in 10 years.

The only the other party we saw yesterday was a young man in a solo
canoe on Kawnipi Lake. He was traveling the opposite direction.

We're now back on the Fisher maps that Royce brought. The way the maps
are segmented, we needed a small area from one map and he had decided
not to bring it. Wish he had&mdash;scrolling around on the tiny GPS screen
isn't fun.

As noted other years, the campsite locations on the Fisher maps are not very
reliable. For example, we found one site across the bay from where we are. It
had not been used in a long time. The put-in was horrible&mdash;rocks. Maybe, if
we'd been wearing magic sandals and had been ten years younger, we might've have
jumped out on the sloped smooth rock but anything else would have required
navigating around underwater obstructions.

This site has a sand landing and some work has been done to take trees down. Not
sure why, since we understand that Quetico does not do maintenance of campsites.
Maybe someone just decided the tree needed to go?

Kawnipi was kind to us and gifted us with swift travels. She's a big lake and
and we've already covered most of her.

### 2025-08-14T20:56:40-05:00 (48.45243, -91.34913) 1279 feet Day 8 West of Rose Island on Kawnipi Lake to Shelly Lake

As we were packing, the wind started gusting. Two guys paddled past in what
looks like MN2. They were making good time but were paddling hard. By the time
we were ready to leave, the increasing wind and growing white caps led us to
decide to wait out the gusts.

On the water around noon. Wind is from the south again. We make good time.

Because of the wind, we left my planned, more open route, and went through the
&ldquo;fiddly bits&rdquo; to reach the portage to Shelly Lake. Most of the shore
is burnt.

All we could see of the portage were down trees. It might've been cleared, but
the way the terrain was, we had to commit to a particular spot or risk being
swept down the rapids. We could not see the portage, so we backtracked to
portage to Montgomery Lake.

This portage was hard to find and it was tough&mdash;lots of rocks and a path so
narrow that the canoe kept catching in the trees. To make it more fun, it had
mucky areas and a small stream crossing The nearby beaver dam may have changed
things, but we think that it's just not much used.

Montgomery Lake also had been heavily burnt, and was, basically, a spruce swamp.
We wonder why anyone would portage here.None of the three campsites showed much
use. The whole place was ugly.

The short portage to Shelly was also burnt. Some work had been done to
open it, but just barely enough. There were trees to clamber over,
boulders to step across, etc. The landing area on the Montgomery side
was a nightmare&mdash;one very large rock surrounded by mid-calf deep loon
poop. And there were lots of rocks that we had to dodge around before we
could get to shore.

We headed south to the first campsite on Shelly. It's on an island that
had mostly burned and is growing back to brush. But there is green grass
and enough space to pitch a tent. The wind was howling so hard that we
put rocks on the stakes and, for the first time, pitched the guy lines.
Of course, when bug time came, the wind died.

Curried rice and bacon for dinner.

When I dug my cat hole, there was a very thin layer of organic matter
over carbon from the last fire, then a few inches of mineral soil, and
then more carbon.

The portages have slowed us down more than we expected. In retrospect,
the Horse (aka Mile) portage was relatively easy because, once we had
our load on, it was just a matter of plodding. The portages for the last
few days have required careful attention to every step. The landings,
usually on both sides tend to be narrow (bow on), which requires a great
deal of fiddling to get the stern paddler (me) and our packs out or the
packs and the bow paddler in.

## 2025-08-15 Day 9: Kawnipi Lake to Russell Lake

### 2025-08-15T20:39:27-05:00 (48.47556, -91.45539) 1246 feet

We went off track twice before we found the portage to Keats. It's a nice
portage.

We meet six young women (Royce guesses they're 20 and younger). They're using
two aluminum canoes that have been treated to look a bit like they were made of
wood and canvas. One had a brass name plate on the bow but I couldn't make it
out. One woman carried each canoe, but they rolled the canoe up in teams of
three&mdash;an interesting technique.

The day started gray and calm then cleared up and got breezy. With the
blue skies and a better vantage, the falls here are more impressive than
those on the Falls chain.

All three portages were well traveled and were reasonably easy to walk, with one
big exception. Early on the portage from Keats to Chatterton we had to step
between boulders that were at 3 to 5 feet high, with several feet between each
bolder. It was extra exciting to step between them while carrying the guide pack
and the canoe.

Some portages were a few hundred feet off where the maps indicated. With a
little careful paddling close to shore, the locations were close enough, but I
updated any location that was off by more than a few tens of feet.

We camped early on Russell Lake. Our plan is to hang out and enjoy the gorgeous
view from our two-story walk-up campsite.

We saw one canoe in the far distance.

We had whiskey and then some more, snacks, then more whiskey. This is the first
time we've been in camp early enough to hang out with nothing urgent to do. It's
quite nice. And we *will* have camp ready before the bug time.

I took a brief, pleasant swim.

Royce rehydrated refried beans and served them in tortillas with cheese, rice,
and hot sauce. That meal is a two-time hit.

After a breezy day, the wind died on schedule and the bugs chased us into the
tent.

Except for the early mistakes, we went to the points where we were meant to be
and made good speed&mdash;a bit faster than 3 mph even when the wind was against
us. Our portage discipline has improved, so we moved efficiently. I'm sure it
helped that the portages were not as exhausting.

Royce discovered that he was depending on his trekking poles too much and that
one pole worked better for him.

DEET leaked out of the pump bottle into the waterproof bag that I carry in the
guide pack and melted through the bottom of the bag, melted the outside of my
glasses case, and damaged my wallet, raincoat, etc. We *must* have a different
way to carry bug dope. Or get something that's not as good as solvent as DEET.
Vickie recommended something but I didn't look into it.

## 2025-08-16 Day 10: Russell Lake to the end of Sturgeon Lake

### 2025-08-16T20:37:53-05:00 (48.42722, -91.71706) 1249 feet

While we were goofing around in camp this morning, two middle-aged women
paddle past, followed by two loud and chatty younger women.

The portage had a mildly difficult landing, which was followed by a steep climb, then a
corduroy section, and then a horrible descent to a landing that must've taken us
20 minutes to half an hour to figure out how to load the boat. Rocks where
everywhere and most of them were scraped with aluminum where others had simply
drug their boats over them. We loaded the boat off of one rock and then I tossed
the line to Royce, who pulled it over to where we could get him. What a mess!

About 40 minutes away from the portage we stopped for lunch at the first easy
place to land. Man, that portage was tough.

Along the way, Royce saw a large pike jump. We also saw something that we
thought was a deadhead, but then it rose a little out of the water, as if to
look at us, and as quickly disappeared. It seemed too far away from shore to be
a beaver, but did seem to be some kind of mammal.

The maps showed us a few close campsites. We aren't in a rush and the idea of a
short day appealed, but the canoe gods were smiling on us, so we decided to take
advantage of the perfect paddling conditions and push to the end of Sturgeon
Lake.

After we turned towards the portage into the Maligne River, we took the first
campsite. It has one reasonable tent site and rocks that have enough breeze that
we could enjoy the sunset without being chased into the tent. Plus we had a
number of dragonflies to provide air cover (hunting around us).

The canoe gods smiled on us again. We crossed Sturgeon under warm and mostly
cloudless skies. The trailing wind occasionally threatened to build up to
something worrisome but always subsided. I don't know our average speed, but I
would expect it to be around 4 mph.

### 2025-08-17T14:32:14-05:00 (48.41288, -91.75146) 1242 feet

Long lunch on a pleasant campsite that is on the third portage going
west. Portages are well traveled and mostly easy.

Chat with a couple that are 7 days into a 21 day trip with their golden
retriever, Willow. Their food barrel is heavy but I can lift it. How do
they manage with two people and a dog?

![Royce fishing on Maligne River 2025-08-17 14:35:25](./attachments/202508171435-000.jpeg "Royce fishing on Maligne River 2025-08-17 14:35:25")

Leave camp at 10 or 11. We only have a short distance to cover today.

### 2025-08-17T20:18:52-05:00 (48.38552, -91.84600) 1213 feet

Ran a few minor rapids that the couple referred to as &ldquo;swifts&rdquo;. I.e.,
not really rapids. They obviously have much more experience with white
water than we do. Heck, they swam one after they portaged it. Royce saw
an otter at the end of one swift.

We took them all seriously because we have a little experience and, for
all of its sterling qualities on lakes, the MN2 is *not* a white water
boat.

Near the beginning of Tanner Lake we entered a burn area. We found a
island campsite but there was a little left of it and it was pretty
depressing. We ended up camping above a fall in the middle of Tanner
Lake that was past the burn. It's a huge, well used site, surrounded by
pines and firs, with multiple tent sites. Just a little duff over rock,
so we could not drive stakes.

It's on a long trail that runs off of the map. Mushers?

Twice tonight we heard what sounds like a Tijuana taxi but we're pretty
are swans. We've seen more swans this year than I've ever seen.

## 2025-08-18 Day 12: Maligne River to Twin Falls on the Maligne River

### 2025-08-18T19:47:56-05:00 (48.28606, -92.18403) 0 feet

![Royce packing. Tanner Lake 2025-08-18 09:41:09](./attachments/202508180941-000.jpeg "Royce packing. Tanner Lake 2025-08-18 09:41:09")

Mosquitoes were about average this trip. At 8 o'clock they turn into a
pestilence. Tonight, because of the misting rain, they chased us into
the tent a bit earlier. Sometimes, on a wind protected portage, they
were an annoyance.

Also, at the beginning of the trip we sweated a lot
on the portages and when we first went to the tent. Last night was the
first time I had the sleeping bag draped over my whole body.

Excepting the issue with closing its door and undoing the toggle for the rain
fly, the Big Agnes tent is a marked improvement over the Timberline 4. It's
lighter, smaller when packed, roomy for two and gear, and is more stable in the
wind. The Timberline zippers had the same problem, though they were less
finicky.

We saw a party with three canoes and six adults coming up river. They
were paddling Grumman canoes and all were using a strange stroke. Maybe
I forgotten what it's like to paddle one of those beasts? Also, no
PFDs!

We took great care on each of the small &ldquo;swifts&rdquo;. Maybe too much care,
but neither of us have experience reading a river. As it was, there were
no surprises.

At Twin Falls, the portage I had marked was not the one that is commonly used.
As a consequence, we used what I dubbed the &ldquo;Not that island Island
Portage&rdquo;.

![Royce looking at Twin Falls on Maligne River](./attachments/202508181329-000.jpeg "Royce lookng at Twin Falls on Maligne River")

We're on the campsite we used on any early 2000s&mdash;maybe 2004&mdash;trip
with Royce, his two sons, and me and was the occasion of the great dunking.

Royce recalls that the flow being much, much lower then, and that the
frothy bowl below the falls (and our camp) was relatively placid and
that he fished it.

## 2025-08-19 Day 13: Twin Falls on Maligne to Eau Claire

![Camp on Twin Falls of Maligne River](./attachments/202508190750-000.jpeg "Camp on Twin Falls of Maligne River")

The last morning of the trip. Everything is damp but it's not raining.

Leslie has confirmed our pickup on Bell Island.

Zups picks us up right on schedule and takes to their base. After
settling our bill, they took us to Crane Lake where we cleared automated
customs.

Some Apple defect locked the satellite conversation with Leslie, so I'm
very glad I had the inReach. For some reason, perhaps an older phone, I
was unable to message Brenda even when it was working well. Also, it was
much harder to get a satellite fixed here than in Boise. Perhaps a
combination of latitude and that there are many more trees?

We didn't count packs at the end and were so focused on tying down the
canoe that we left the pack with all of our clothes, sleeping bags etc.
on the docks at Crane Lake. Fortunately, someone at Scott's brought the
pack and my PFD in and will hold them. Royce will get them after the
party for Ripley.

## 2025-08-21 Leave Eau Claire

Leaving Eau Claire to celebrate Ripley's 1 1/2 birthday.
