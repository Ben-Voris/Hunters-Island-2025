# To Do, Lessons Learned & Things to Consider

## To do

- [ ] Replace the failed, large waterproof bag. See
      [To waterproof clothes, sleeping bags, etc.](#how-to-waterproof-clothes-sleeping-bags-etc)
- [ ] Buy 2 or 3 large pack liners
- [ ] Buy a small waterproof bag for guide pack. The failed pack was a 20L Black
      Canyon from Seal Line. It was amply large. This bag must be at large
      enough at least for toilet kit and, likely, the first aid kit.
- [ ] Store DEET in something made of metal or resistant plastic.
- [ ] Inspect canoe patches. Some are peeling away.
- [ ] Per Ian, “flashing” tape for canoe repair.
- [ ] Gorilla tape for general repairs.
- [ ] Get and test waterproof bag for phone.
- [ ] Put ballpoint pens for marking Fisher maps into map case.

## Lessons Learned

- Bring DEET only in a screw-top bottle.
- Wrapping DEET in a standard ziplock only adds to the melted mess. We need
  need something resistant.
- Even so, do not store DEET near other important gear. E.g., rain gear,
  waterproof bags, etc.
- Cut cheese into servings and wrap each separately in something like snack
  bags. We’re trying to reduce how much we handle the goo that comes off cheese
  in warm weather.
- Royce says he should pack less fishing gear
- Magic sandals with GoreTex socks work well enough that spare boots are
  unnecessary.
- Charging cables are light and do fail. Carry two.
- Kodiak brand oatmeal is notably better than Quaker.
- Carry old-fashioned ballpoint pens (e.g., Bic) to write on Fisher maps.
- **Before** the trip, mark the paper maps with waypoints from the GPS.
- [Guide pack](#guide-pack-load) got too heavy.

## To Consider

### How to waterproof clothes, sleeping bags, etc

1. One large bag waterproof bag, like now?
2. A smaller rubber pack for each person? The ones with hip belts look easier
   to carry.
3. Use the food barrel for the key gear (e.g., sleeping bags) and put overflow
   into waterproof bags that fit into a blue canvas pack. This would only work
   for a shorter trips in warm weather.

### Saw

Consider not carrying the saw on warm weather trips as we don’t typically want a
fire then. On the other hand, maybe its weight and hassle are worth in case we
need to do emergency trail clearing. And, not all summer trips are so warm.

### Hatchet

The new hatchet is light but cannot be used to pound stakes. We never used it.

1. Stop carrying a hatchet?
2. Keep carrying it for emergencies?
3. Carry a hatchet that can be used to pound stakes?
4. Carry only on trip in cooler weather? We used to carry a "boys' axe" on fall
   trips.

### Stoves

Does it make sense to carry a separate stove, fuel, and pot for coffee? It is
easier to start an iso-butane stove but iirc, we only used it twice in 14 days:
on one of the first morning, because we had it, and again after our nap after
the Horse Portage. Most mornings, I used the WisperLite.

We carried out nearly a liter of white gas.

### Guide Pack load

I bought *The Guide Pack* to organize &ldquo;hand things&rdquo;, like water
bottles, and to carry things that we did not want to open other packs to access
(e.g., snacks, rain gear, toilet kit). Soon, some emergency gear (e.g., first
aid, hatchet) went into it. On day trips, it was often the the only pack.

This trip, its weight seemed excessive, particularly as we lightened the gear
and personal packs by moving things to the food barrels.

I loaded it with:

- Up to ~5 liters or ~10 pounds of water
- Lunch in whatever form it was packaged. Some days that was a block of cheese
  (2 pounds?) and a ten pack of flour tortillas.
- A few bars and meat sticks as snacks
- Waterproof bag
  - Rain gear
  - First aid kit
  - Toilet kit
  - Spare batteries for GPS, sometimes more than a few.

Can we drop it? I want a place to put water bottles and toilet kit, but, in
principle, everything else could go into other packs.

#### Reducing the weight

Carrying less water is the obvious point. However, we did run out more than a
few times.

- Carry less filtered water and come up with some way to quickly get more
  potable water (e.g., scoop water mid-lake and use a Steripen).
- Move some filtered water into another pack. (We did this one one liter but
  we could do more.)
- Move some gear, like first aid, to personal packs or gear packs.
- Load only enough food for one lunch.
- Load no lunch and open the food barrels at lunch?
- Decide that the weight is worth it.
